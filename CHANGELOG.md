  - Authors can now make changes to the generated directory structure by mapping their folders within `package.json`.
* Added logic to read JSON files within the `_data` folder that will be loaded into chosen template engine attached to `site.data` object.
* Added [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) to ensure production code is used in browserify builds
* Updated linter to use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) instead of [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) for better ES6 support and easier configuration.
* Updated [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) tasks to now use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) instead. Have seen a major speedup as well as much less code needed.
* Updated [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/) templates to now be [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as the syntax is identical. [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/) has also been somewhat abandoned and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is backed by Mozilla
* Updated folder structure to utilize a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)-esque underscore prefixes.
  - Folders prefixed with an underscore (`_`) will not be copied over to build targets (ex. `_styles`).

  - Module: Creates a new module within it's own folder (ex `_modules/newmodule/newmodule.pug`). Along with JavaScript, unit test, and stylesheet.
  - Layout: Creates a new layout witin the layout folder (ex `_layouts/newlayout.pug`).
* Updated all sub-generator unit tests to be created within their own `tests` folder.
* Updated all scripts to utilize [Babel](http://babeljs.io), which enables ES6 features out of the box.
* Removed [Injector](https://github.com/klei/grunt-injector) and [Wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep) as debugging them for errors was difficult and confusing.
* Removed React, AngularJS, and Backbone choices and move them to a new generator called [Neopolitan](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-neopolitan)
* Removed Node + Express choices and move them to a new generator called [Pistacheo](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-pistacheo)
* Removed RequireJS option. All projects use Browserify.
* Removed Bower in favor of soley using NPM for dependency management.
* Removed SVN as a version control option within prompts. Added [guide](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#guides) for SVN usage instead.
* Removed authentication boilerplates (Deperecated in last release `0.14.x`).
* Removed old guides as they will not work with this latest version of Yeogurt.
* Removed style and script sub-generators as they were not that useful.
* Removed IE8 Support. IE9 is the default lowest browser supported.
* Removed Vanilla JavaScript and CSS options.
* Removed Dashboard, KSS, and JSDoc automated documentation as each implementation was quite buggy and difficult to manage.
  - NOTE: Dashboard can still be achieved with the new `_data` structure. Check out the [example](https://github.com/larsonjj/yeogurt-dashboard-example) on how to get it working.

##### changes:
* Added [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) option for Single Page Applications
 - Templates auto compiled to single JS payload and added to $templateCache using [`grunt-angular-templates`](https://github.com/ericclemmons/grunt-angular-templates)
 - Angular scripts automatically converted to min-safe using [grunt-ng-annotate](https://github.com/mzgol/grunt-ng-annotate). (Angular shorthand DI can be used)
 - Modular Structure based on [John Papa's Styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide)
 - 8 new AngularJS sub-generators
  - [Route](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#route)
  - [Service](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#service)
  - [Factory](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#factory)
  - [Controller](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#controller)

  - 4 space indent has been changed to 2
  - [jscs](http://jscs.info/) is now used to enforce new style rules (for yeogurt repo only)
  - Differences: Allow 120 characters instead of the default 80. Also allow `else` on new lines.
* Authentication boilerplates for React, Backbone, Pug, and Swig have been deprecated (will be removed from next release `0.15.0`)
  - Yeogurt already does so much that handling a large boilerplate codebase will make releases take much longer and ultimately slow down development. So these need to be removed.
* Removed FTP deployment prompts. Instead, a [guide](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt/blob/master/docs/guides/ftp.md) has been added on how to implement it.
  - Going forward, guides will be added for more deployment options. (i.e. Heroku, Openshift, etc)
* Removed sourcemaps from usemin tasks (they were very inaccurate)

* Removed ability to use React with RequireJS (too many custom configurations to get react to work with r.js optimizer)
* Removed all H5BP extras (adobe xdomain, IE11 icons, apple touch icon, and htaccess) as they were a bit superfluous for most projects and are easily added after project generation.

***Additions***
* Added ability to read existing `.yo-rc.json` files to load existing configuration
* Added `--allow-remote` option for `grunt serve`, `grunt serve:dist`, and `grunt serve:watch` tasks, so you can access your app/site from remote devices on the same network
* Added new option to generate a Node + express server
* Added new option to work with either MySQL (via [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)) or MongoDB (via [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose)) with an express server
* Added new option to enable express security with Paypal's [Lusca](https://github.com/krakenjs/lusca) module
* Added Database information prompts: host, port, username, password, etc if you choose to use a database
* Added shim to get react working with phantomJS when running unit tests
* Added new option to render React components on the server.
* Added seperate `grunt serve:docs` task to update documentation when files are changed. This means that by default `grunt serve` will not recompile KSS, JSDoc, or the dashbaord. This allows for much faster rebuilds by default.
* Added ES5 shims to properly support IE8 when using React
* Added `*.ico` files to `grunt-copy` task to make sure `favicon.ico` is loaded up correctly
* Added `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'` to `grunt build` task to help remove dev comments from react npm module
* Added 150+ tests for generator and sub-generators to ensure code stability and reduce bugs. Should also allow for faster releases.
* Added `grunt test:watch` task to allow for test file watching and auto re-run of those tests when changes are detected.
* Added new prompt to choose whether or not unit testing JavaScript is desired. (No longer required to generate unit tests)
* Added filter maps for prompt values to make prompt messages easier to change

***Updates***
* Updated generator prompts to be categorized so they are easier to follow
* Updated and revamped `README.md` documentation.
* Updated all automated forms of documentation to use jQuery and Less for much easier custom theming
* Updated 'dev/' folder to now be 'client/'.
* Updated React to v0.11.x
* Updated sub-generators to have the `--folder` option. Meaning placement of generated files can be customized.
* Updated bootstrap to 4.3.x and updated all corresponding links to adhere to new bower_components structure
* Updated style and view subgenerators to no longer require the `--import` flag as [`grunt-injector`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-injector) has been implemented to handle all file include/import injections now.
* Updated grunt-sass to 0.14.x and added a 10 decimal precision option, so as to correctly compile large decimal numbers. (fixes many css issues with bootstrap and foundation)
* Updated `connect:server` to serve up the `dev/.serve` folder as root so Backbone router pushState will work
* Update: For single page applications and static sites using only HTML, `index.html` moved from `dev/` to `lib/templates` when using express server.
* Update: For Static Sites using preprocessors (Pug, Swig, etc), `base` template file has moved from `dev/` to `client/templates/layouts` or `server/templates/layouts` if using express server

* Fixed reloading of Lo-dash, handlebars, and pug client-side templates when running `grunt serve`
